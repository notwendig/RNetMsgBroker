# R-Net JSON catalogue

`R-Net.json` must be syntactically valid JSON and should use only the canonical keys documented here.

## Required / recommended frame fields

```json
{
  "Id-and-mask": "0x7FF",
  "id-result": "0x00E",
  "key-mask": "0x7FF",
  "rnet_name": "RNetJsmSerialHeartbeat",
  "frametype": "serial",
  "phase": "startup.serial_auth",
  "quelle": "jsm",
  "senke": "pm",
  "summary": "JSM serial heartbeat during startup.",
  "zyklus": "50ms",
  "id_parts": [],
  "fields": []
}
```

## Field entries

```json
{
  "name": "x_axis",
  "byte": 0,
  "width": 1,
  "signed": true,
  "big_endian": true,
  "description": "X-axis signed int8"
}
```

## Canonical spellings

Use only the canonical spellings shown above. Typo aliases are not accepted.

## Meaning of phase / quelle / senke

- `phase`: logical protocol phase, for example `startup.serial_auth`, `startup.config_discovery`, `runtime.normal_operation`, `unknown.observed`.
- `quelle`: likely source. This is inferred from known R-Net conventions and the current trace; candump itself does not prove the sender.
- `senke`: likely target or interested receiver.

## Unknown but observed

Use this for frames that match a repeated pattern but whose meaning is not proven:

```json
"phase": "unknown.observed"
```

This is different from a real decoder `UNKNOWN` output. It means the frame is recognized but not fully understood.
